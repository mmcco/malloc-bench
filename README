A few simple dynamic allocator benchmarks.

If you're running these on Linux, you'll need to use libbsd for
reallocarray(3) and strtonum(3). This just involves including
bsd/stdlib.h in every C file and adding -lbsd to LDFLAGS.

Current benchmarks:

 * pass-off [-t nthreads] [-s alloc_size] [-n niters]:
 
   A master thread makes allocations and sends them to worker
   threads to be freed in a round-robin manner.

 * round [-t nthreads] [-s alloc_size] [-n niters]:
 
   Multiple threads repeatedly make a number of allocations (1000,
   by default) all at once and then free them.

 * spin [-t nthreads] [-s alloc_size] [-n niters]:
 
   Multiple threads make allocations and immediately free them.
